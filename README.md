## 🌌 About Me

Hey, I'm **BOLT** — a developer from India building projects from the void.

I started with zero web knowledge and began creating real projects while learning.  
I believe in building while learning, not waiting to be perfect.

⚡ Currently learning and mastering:
- 🐍 Python
- 🌐 HTML
- 🎨 CSS
- ⚙️ JavaScript

I build games, experimental websites, and dark-themed developer projects.
